Writing Effective Bug Reports
When creating bug reports, it's important to include certain key elements that product support 
teams will expect and require. When submitting your bug reports, make sure to include:

The function being tested (e.g. login)
The initial state of the system (e.g. the system is on and idle)
Detailed steps to reproduce the defect/bug (e.g. insert a card, enter the correct card number and 
PIN)
The expected outcome (e.g. the system should successfully accept the customer and display the banking menu)
The actual outcome (e.g. the system crashes or displays an error message)
