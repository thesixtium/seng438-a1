# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing is a type of testing where testers learn about the application, design tests, and excute them at the same time without relying on predefined test cases. For the ATM simulation system, testers will read Appendix B: High Level Requirements and attempt to recreate the functionality described in those requirements. This will ensure all high-level requirements are tested while maintaining the flexibility and discovery-oriented nature of exploratory testing, without requiring predefined test cases.

Exploratory testing will be conducted for 30 minutes per testing pair. Given this time constraint, not all functionality may be able to be thoroughly explored. Therefore, testers will need to strategically prioritize which functionality they deem most important and test those areas first, ensuring that critical system functions receive adequate attention.

To accomplish effective exploratory testing within the time constraint, testers will follow this structured approach:
1. Read the High Level Requirements: Testers will begin by reading Appendix B to understand the system's expected behavior. This step provides clear goals for what the system should be able to do, understanding of the complete transaction workflow, and awareness of system constraints.
2. Identify the Most Important Requirements: Based on the requirements review, testers will prioritize functionality for testing. This involves assessing which functions are used most frequently by customers, which failures would have the most severe impact on users or security,, and which areas are the most complex and therefore most prone to defects.
3. Perform Actions: For each function selected as high priority from the requirements, testers will systematically attempt to perform the action on the simulation. This involves executing each prioritized function and verifing that the system behaves as specified in the requirements.
4. Report Bugs: If the expected outcomes based on requirements and actual outcomes of an action differ, the tester will document the bug on Jira, complete with the expected outcome, actual outcome, steps taken to create the error, etc.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
